I am a Software Team Leader with over **14** years of experience in developing and maintaining web and mobile applications, backend APIs, and microservices.

Skilled in leading teams of developers to successfully deliver complex software projects. I am not afraid of architectural or technical challenges. Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to build strong relationships with team members and stakeholders.

I have experience in mentoring team members to level up their skills. Proficient in various programming languages and technologies, primarily *C#*, *.NET*, *Entity Framework \[Core\]*, *ASP.NET MVC \[Core\]*, *OOP/OOD*, *Software Design Patterns*, *TDD*, *Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ)*, *Microservice Architecture*, *Kubernetes*, *Docker*, *PowerShell \[Core\]*, *CI/CD*, with a focus on creating efficient and scalable software solutions.

Outside of work, I authored several non-commercial projects as technology PoC or automation tools.

I have 8 years of experience in software development. I am proficient in C#, .NET, Entity Framework, ASP.NET  MVC, OOP/OOD, Software Design Patterns, TDD, Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and I am experienced in Mobile Development in UWP and Xamarin.

Regarding my work habits, I am a focused, goal-oriented worker with a very analytical mind. Frequently, I start independent projects just for fun including my own website and framework and various tools and small utilities, Mobile (Windows) apps. In these projects, I have used technologies that I am interested in but are not used in a corporate environment like Bot Framework. I work very well with a team, in fact, I prefer it to working by myself as I love both giving and receiving advice to and from others
